===============

Set of utility scripts to facilitate work in Unity.

Currently, it includes:
* Extension methods for:
  * GameObjects
  * Numbers and comparable types
  * Lists and arrays
  * Vectors
  * Strings
  * Colors
  * Date/Time
* A Timer and ManagedTimer type, useful to do things after a certain time.
* Definition of type Tuple (Tuple-2, Tuple-3 and Tuple-4) for generic types (Tuple&lt;int, string&gt; or Tuple&lt;MyClass, GameObject&gt;, for example).
* Gizmo-helpers for the Editor.
* Various helpful functions, like calculation of positions over a sphere and HSV-defined (Hue, Saturation, Value) color, among others.
* A FSM (Finite-state Machine) system that takes advantage of Unity's scripting engine.


Examples of usage will be included in future updates.
